TODO:
- 1. move item data into its own key `data`
    avoid conflict if the data also has a `type` key itself
    easier to type cast
- 2. for dragging a post there's 2 cases:
    source type: always post
    target type: section or post
    - if section: move post to section, update sort index if necessary
    - if post: reorder post
- 3. for dragging a section there's only 1 case:
    source type: always section
    target type: section
- 4. let the caller handle all states, only fire events
